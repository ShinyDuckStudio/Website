      <h1>New Dog, Old Tricks</h1>
      <p>
        New game from ShinyDuck Studio, 
        <a class="italique">New Dog, Old Tricks</a> mixes mysteries, adventures, and 
        puzzles to offer players a gaming experience 
        in the style of retro games.

        Also abbreviated as <a class="italique">NDOT</a>, it is a cooperative multiplayer game.

        <br><br>
        During a simple walk in the woods, you and your friend trigger a tragedy for one of you : because of an ancient artefact that crossed your path, one of you was turned into a dog. This stroll then changes into a real adventure. You are now both involved in a quest to concoct a potion that will (hopefully) give back his human appearance to the one that now stands on four legs, barking to communicateâ€¦ 
        Therefore, you will need to explore the forest that surounds you, searching for the ingredients that will allow you to turn everything back to normal. You will venture into the heart of the forest, solving the enigms it hides. Be careful, the woods might not be as peaceful as they seem to be on the first look !
        <br><br>
        <a class = "italique">New Dog, Old Tricks</a> will immerse you in the retro-fantastic universe of our childhood puzzle games. You will have to count on your game partnerâ€™s skills and on your cooperation to overcome the obstacles on your journey. Sharpen your reflexion, your listening and collaborating skills, take a deep breath and enter this mysterious forest that should be the cure to this canine curse.
        <br><br>
        The forest in which you will evolve in <a class = "italique">New Dog, Old Tricks</a> is composed of three principal areas that will mark different ways of solving enigms.
        In the first area, at the edge of the forest, you will discover the principal mecanics that will accompagny you during your adventure. The enigms will be focused on your interaction with the mecanisms and the objects around you.
        By progressing further in the woods, you will reach the second area of the game, in which the peace of your journey will be disturbed. The enigms will be focused on taking care of the hostile creatures you will meet there.
        Finally, when entering the heart of the forest, you will need to use everything you learnt during your journey. You will find the most complex puzzles, combining different mecanisms and ennemies, but you will also be very close to your goal.
        Thanks to the ingredients you will find in each area of the game, it will finally be possible for you to concoct the potion you heard about.</p>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
          With <a class="italique">New Dog, Old Tricks</a>, <a class="gras" href="../">ShinyDuck Studio</a> aims to revive the nostalgic genre of retro puzzle games. This return to roots, however, comes with a twist: mandatory interaction between both players to progress and solve puzzles.
          With different abilities, you'll need to combine your skills with those of your gaming partner to successfully complete your mission. You'll often find yourselves dependent on each other, making cooperation essential to overcome the challenges that lie ahead!
          <br><br>
          <a class="italique">New Dog, Old Tricks</a> allows us to explore our behavior in social settings. As in life, you'll need to navigate relationships to move forward. Everyone is different, and sometimes communication can be challenging (especially between a dog and a human). Despite differing perspectives, cooperation helps transcend individual limitations and tackle the toughest obstacles.
          <br><br>
          <a class="italique">New Dog, Old Tricks</a> could never have come to fruition without the collaboration of our team. We sincerely hope that in addition to providing you with the satisfaction of playing our game, we'll also foster an appreciation for cooperation that leads to victory.
